Static site generators (SSGs) are my favorite way to build content-driven websites. They offer a delightful mix of performance, simplicity, and developer control that I haven’t found in other tools.

## What is an SSG?

A static site generator is a tool that takes your content (often written in Markdown) and your templates (usually HTML or Razor) and produces a fully static website that can be deployed anywhere — no backend required.

:::tip
The output of an SSG is just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can host it on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or even Azure Static Web Apps.

## Why I Love Them

There are a few key reasons static site generators have earned my love:

### 💨 They're Blazing Fast

Because they pre-render everything at build time, there’s no waiting on a server to generate pages. That means instant page loads and top-tier Lighthouse scores out of the box.

Performance isn’t just good UX — it’s good SEO, especially on mobile.
:::

### 🔧 Total Control Over Content

I can write content in Markdown, customize layout in Razor, and inject components where needed. No CMS interface telling me what I can and can’t do.

:::proTip
Use partial views or components for common content blocks like callouts, post headers, or author cards.
:::

### 🔐 No Backend, No Worries

With no server-side runtime, your attack surface shrinks dramatically. That’s a big win for personal sites, documentation, and blogs.

:::important
No backend doesn't mean no security — you still need to secure your build pipeline and hosting platform.
:::

## Downsides?

No tool is perfect. The build step can be slow on larger sites, and dynamic features like comments or search require extra effort (usually via client-side JS or external services).

:::warning
SSGs are not ideal for highly dynamic, user-driven applications like dashboards or social platforms.
:::

## When to Reach for an SSG

Use static site generators when:
- Content is primarily authored by you or your team
- Pages don’t change per user
- You want great performance with minimal hosting complexity

## Final Thoughts

SSGs aren’t just a tool — they’re a mindset. By embracing static rendering and decoupling content from infrastructure, I’ve found web development to be more fun and less stressful.
